[x] better editor (eval of current line, region, keystroke) => codemirror?
[ ] simple parser to a 'sampler cutter language'
[ ] sintax to change sample files on-the-fly
[ ] documentation
--- milestone 0.1
[ ] how to be compatible with Web Audio API and use its filters?
[ ] DSL to synth/pattern/duration/sampler/fx creation and live editing
--- milestone 0.2
[ ] show sliders UI on vars (Bret Victor concepts for reactive docs)
[ ] socket.io to allow other people to jam together, each one with an editor
--- milestone 0.3
[ ] add permutations (cycle operations on sets, see ABT)
[ ] OSC devices with osc-web (we have to work on osc-web first)
--- milestone 0.4

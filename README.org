* Introduction

Livecoding is an alternative way to compose and interpret music in real-time. 
The performer/composer plays on a laptop and shows your screen to the public, 
making them part of the performance and even understanding what the musician 
is really doing to generate that weird sounds. Livecoders commonly use general 
domain languages or creates their own computer music languages. 

Vivace is an attempt to create a Livecoding language that runs in the Open Web 
using the new Web Audio and Audio Data APIs.
